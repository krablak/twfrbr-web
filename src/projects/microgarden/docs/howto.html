                <p>Here it is. First day in the new garden. A few birches, some grass and a few bushes.</p>
                <p>From now on, the garden takes on a life of its own and will need your care.</p>
                <p>Use the crown to turn and explore the garden. Tap the screen to open the main menu.</p>

                <p>It's your garden and it's up to you how it looks. Something you don't like? Just cut it and it's gone.</p>
                <p>Before you cut something, take a look at what it actually is and these icons will give you a hint:</p>

                <p><span class="icon water">▼</span> Consumes water</p>
